2. In the terminal at ~:
	mkdir ~/.npm-global
	npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
	code ~/.zshrc
3. In VS code, add the lines and save:
	export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
	export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
4. Back in the terminal, refresh it by:
	source ~/.zshrc
5. Now install the necessary packages with npm just like pip:
	npm install http-server -g
	npm install -g p5-manager
6. cd into your preferred working directory and create a sketch:
	p5 generate --bundle "mysketch"
7. cd into your sketch folder and start a server:
	http-server
8. Paste the address into the browser. In developer tool settings > Network > disable cache while developer tools are open
9. To edit the sketch, open a new tab (cmd+t). You can set this to default to the same directory in preferences. Then open VS code:
	code .
